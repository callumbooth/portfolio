                  I’m a hard working and enthusiastic software engineer with a
                  passion for front end development. I have an FdA in graphic
                  design and spent over 3 years experience working in a busy
                  marketing agency along with 4 years development experience
                  which has given me a strong set of skills to deliver high
                  quality products.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After starting with Bluetel Solutions recently, I have jumped
                  into working with an agile team to help create and refine
                  project tasks, along with implementing new functionality as
                  well as improving and refactoring existing code in the
                  product.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Previously working with Moodle a learning management system,
                  where I have helped bring projects from initial concept right
                  through to development and release. Working both individually
                  and as part of a team, delivering products to customers, and
                  implementing tools to help with the day to day tasks, such as
                  incorporating version control systems (git) and task managers
                  (gulp, grunt, webpack).
                </p>
                <p>
                  My skill set is primarily JavaScript, PHP, MySQL along with
                  HTML and CSS. I have strong experience CSS preprocessors using
                  SASS and have built projects using React, and Electron. I also
                  have good understanding of REST API’s and have built GraphQL
                  API's to improve data flow between multiple front and back end
                  systems, along with integrating into a Salesforce CRM and the
                  HubSpot marketing platform.
                </p>

                  Outside of work I enjoy computer games, having been ranked in
                  the 1% for multiple games and photography both of which give
                  me inspiration to create new ideas and deal with problems in
                  alternate ways.
